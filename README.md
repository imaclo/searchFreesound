## Search Freesound React/Next.js App

This app is available live on AWS Amplify at [https://first-branch.d1hp3ehu13i5jr.amplifyapp.com/](https://first-branch.d1hp3ehu13i5jr.amplifyapp.com/).

The brief for this technical test was:


* Start with a search box that accepts input

* When return/enter (‚èé) is pressed, we want to GET: https://freesound.org/apiv2/...

* The API requires authentication to be provided via the Authorization header, with value xxx

* Inspect the API response to understand the contents

* Display the name of each result in an unordered list

* Paginate the list of results

* Clicking on an item will automatically start playing an audio preview of the selected item inside a native HTML audio player

* Prevent typing in the input box or paginating while a request is in progress
